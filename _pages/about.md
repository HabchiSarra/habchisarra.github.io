**Bio:**I am a Principal R&D Scientist dedicated to advancing software quality and reliability, with a focus on software testing, continuous integration, and automation. As the leader of the software engineering research group at Ubisoft [La Forge](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge), I drive innovation in quality engineering to tackle the unique challenges of the video game industry. I hold a PhD in computer science from the University of Lille, where my research on mobile-specific code smells earned the Gilles Kahn Prize for its impact on mobile app quality.

**Narrative CV:**   
During my computer science degree, I discovered my passion for software engineering and decided to specialise in it. 
I did an internship at Inria that initiated me to the research on software code smells. 
By the end of this internship, I was awarded a CORDIS fellowship from Inria to do a [PhD](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02414928/file/Validated-Thesis.pdf) on mobile-specific code smells. 
I dedicated my PhD to the identification and analysis of emerging code smells that can impact the experience of mobile app users. 
I found that these smells are generally ignored by developers and they accumulate in mobile apps without being refactored. 
This ignorance is due to misconceptions about the relationship between coding practices and performance bottlenecks. 
The originality of this thesis earned a [distinction](https://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/2021/01/recherche-prix-de-these-gilles-kahn-laureats-2020/) from the Société Informatique de France as part of the Gilles Kahn prize (2020). Through my PhD, I realised the necessity of considering industrial practices and contexts in my research. For this purpose, for my postdoc, I joined the SerVal team at the University of Luxembourg. 
My current works focus on test reliability and intend to build solutions that re-establish the trust in continuous integration pipelines. 
These works are motivated by discussions with partners and the proposed solutions are regularly tested and verified on their development infrastructures.
