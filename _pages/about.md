**Bio:** 
 Sarra Habchi is a research and development scientist at Ubisoft [La Forge](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge). She received her PhD in computer science from the University of Lille with a thesis on the identification and tracking of mobile-specific code smells. Her research interests lie primarily in the area of software quality and reliability, with an emphasis on software testing, continuous integration systems, and automation tools. Sarra is currently leading the software engineering research group at Ubisoft La Forge, which focuses on quality engineering challenges in the video game industry.

**Narrative CV:**   
During my computer science degree, I discovered my passion for software engineering and decided to specialise in it. 
I did an internship at Inria that initiated me to the research on software code smells. 
By the end of this internship, I was awarded a CORDIS fellowship from Inria to do a [PhD](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02414928/file/Validated-Thesis.pdf) on mobile-specific code smells. 
I dedicated my PhD to the identification and analysis of emerging code smells that can impact the experience of mobile app users. 
I found that these smells are generally ignored by developers and they accumulate in mobile apps without being refactored. 
This ignorance is due to misconceptions about the relationship between coding practices and performance bottlenecks. 
The originality of this thesis earned a [distinction](https://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/2021/01/recherche-prix-de-these-gilles-kahn-laureats-2020/) from the Société Informatique de France as part of the Gilles Kahn prize (2020). Through my PhD, I realised the necessity of considering industrial practices and contexts in my research. For this purpose, for my postdoc, I joined the SerVal team at the University of Luxembourg. 
My current works focus on test reliability and intend to build solutions that re-establish the trust in continuous integration pipelines. 
These works are motivated by discussions with partners and the proposed solutions are regularly tested and verified on their development infrastructures.
