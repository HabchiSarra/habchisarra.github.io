## Keynote at the _[International Workshop on Games and Software Engineering 2025]([https://conf.researchr.org/info/icpc-2024/keynotes](https://sites.google.com/view/icsegasworkshop2025)_ 
**Title: Advances and Opportunities in Game Testing and Triage** 
<!-- **Abstract:** Video games have grown into the largest entertainment industry, generating over $200 billion in annual revenue. Modern games are not only massive in scale but also highly complex systems, composed of interconnected components such as graphics and rendering systems, AI systems, and physics simulations. This complexity makes building these games a monumental task—and testing them an even greater challenge.
Today, game testing still heavily relies on manual processes, as automation remains difficult to implement. The interactive and stochastic nature of games, combined with their sheer size and the vast number of configurations to verify, makes automating tests inherently challenging. As a result, manual approaches often struggle to scale with the growing size of games and the rapid pace of development cycles. In addition, developers face overwhelming demands when triaging the thousands of issues uncovered during testing and reported by players, further complicating the process.
In this keynote, I will explore how automation is steadily transforming game testing and triage, alleviating some of these challenges. Drawing from both research and industry practices, I will showcase techniques that are improving testing workflows and enhancing issue triage. I will also discuss current limitations and highlight opportunities for the software engineering community to address the gaps that remain. -->

## Invited talk at the _[International Software Engineering Summer School 2024](https://siesta.si.usi.ch/2024/)_ 
**Title: Overcoming Engineering Obstacles in AAA Game Productions: Practical Solutions and Future Directions** 
<!-- **Abstract:** The development of high-budget AAA video games is a complex and demanding process, requiring substantial effort and meticulous organization. These projects typically require coordinating multidisciplinary teams, including developers, artists, and sound engineers, who produce various code and data artifacts. Moreover, these games must be compatible and scalable across various platforms, such as gaming consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. This multiplatform requirement introduces unique engineering challenges, demanding innovative research and development solutions. In this talk, I will explore the main challenges faced by game development teams in areas like testing, continuous integration, performance analysis, and bug triage. I will also present initiatives from our research group that address these challenges, showcasing novel approaches to enhance performance, improve build system efficiency, and integrate automated testing. -->

## Talk at the _[Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2024](https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2024/session/detail/s664f01912f341/)_ 
**Title: Practical AI Applications for Improving Game Development Pipelines** 
<!-- **Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of game development, offering unprecedented enhancements to various aspects of the development pipeline. While initial interests are predominantly centered on code and content generation, AI's potential extends far beyond these early applications. This talk will delve into the strategic use of AI to ensure the efficiency and stability of game development pipelines. First, I will present an AI-based solution for code review automation that aims to reduce the review burden by summarizing patches, reorganizing the review flow, and suggesting review comments to code reviewers. Then, I will explore AI-based optimization techniques for Continuous Integration (CI), showing how their adoption can provide developers with faster feedback and reduce the number of CI failures. Through a detailed presentation of these solutions and their validation processes, I will highlight the effectiveness of AI in these critical areas while also discussing the trade-offs between cost, efficiency, and quality, providing valuable insights on how to balance these factors when integrating AI into your workflow. -->


## Keynote at the _[International Conference on Program Comprehension 2024](https://conf.researchr.org/info/icpc-2024/keynotes)_ 
**Title: Cultivating Research to Enhance the CI/CD of AAA Video Games** 
<!-- **Abstract:** Developing high-budget video games is a complex process that demands significant effort and meticulous organization. These games consist of an extensive amount of code, estimated to be in the tens of millions of lines, distributed across hundreds of thousands of files, and requiring tens of thousands of code changes. The development of modern AAA games poses additional challenges due to the need to manage multidisciplinary teams, including developers, artists, and sound engineers, which is markedly different from typical code-only projects. In addition, these games must be designed to be compatible and scalable across multiple platforms, including various consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. In this environment, unique engineering challenges emerge, requiring novel research and development solutions from our community. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of the predicaments encountered by game development teams, focusing on the effectiveness and efficiency of testing and continuous integration processes. Drawing from practical experience, I will also discuss initiatives our research group has undertaken to address these challenges and demonstrate how such initiatives can be adopted in game production workflows. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion of open challenges, exploring potential research opportunities arising from the latest advances in AI and delving into its role in shaping future works. -->
