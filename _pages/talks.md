## Keynote at the _[Consortium for Software Engineering Research 2023 Spring Meeting](https://www.cser.ca/2023s/)_ 
**Abstract:**  Developing high-budget video games is a complex process that demands significant effort and meticulous organization. These games consist of an extensive amount of code, estimated to be in the tens of millions of lines, distributed across hundreds of thousands of files, and requiring tens of thousands of code changes. The development of modern AAA games poses additional challenges due to the need to manage multidisciplinary teams, including developers, artists, and sound engineers, which is markedly different from typical code-only projects. In addition, these games must be designed to be compatible and scalable across multiple platforms, including various consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. In this environment, unique engineering challenges emerge, requiring novel research and development solutions from our community. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of predicaments encountered by game development teams, covering topics such as performance analysis, automated testing, and cross-artifact build systems. Then, I will present some of the initiatives conducted by our research group to address these challenges. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion of open challenges and potential research opportunities.
